# DevCards-Backend

DevCards is a full-stack application designed to help developers of all skill levels review, practice, and master programming concepts at their own pace.

This project was developed as part of my final group project at the NorthCoders Software Engineering bootcamp. The REST API was hosted on [Render](https://dev-cards.onrender.com). 
Note: The API is hosted on a free-tier plan, which may result in longer initial load times as the server spins up
